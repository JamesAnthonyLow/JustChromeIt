Easy way to test your html pages by opening a chrome window from the command line

I wrote this bash script so that I could easily preview any html pages I am working on.

It's super easy to use!

just enter:

chrome myfile.html 

That's all you need to do.

Additionally I've included a flag "-u" in case you want to open a webpage:

chrome -u www.github.com

That's it!


I'm also working on an install script so stay tuned!  : )
